	<h2>Distributed Systems</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><h3>Scalable Web Service (Java) </h3> - Designed a simulated multi-tier web hosting service (online store) to maximize the total revenue by ensuring short client response times, while minimizing running costs (number of VMs running). The front and application servers scale out dynamically depending on client inter arrival time and queue length. Write-through caching tier is added to reduce the bottleneck caused by database server (backend server) </li>

		<li><h3>Distributed Caching Proxy Servers (Java) </h3> - Designed a multiple proxy system which performs whole file caching in a client-server RPC system. Proxy servers implement LRU replacement policy to reduce end to end latency. The overall project represents the concept of Content Delivery Network (CDN) prevalent in modern client server computing architecture <li>
		
		<h3>Remote Procedure Call System (RPC) (C) </h3> - Implemented an RPC system which supports transparent client file operations (open, read write, lseek, etc.) at the server. Designed the serialization protocol between the inter positioned client library and server, marshaled parameters and un-marshaled return values (C)</li>
	</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="project">
	<h2>Storage Systems</h2>
	<ul>
	<li><h3>File System Checker (C) </h3> - Designed a fsck utility to identify, parse, read, and manipulate an on-disk image of an ext2 file system 
	(C, ext2)</li>
	<li><h3>Hybrid Cloud File System (C, FUSE) </h3> - Designed a hybrid cloud file system based on FUSE which uses local SSD and amazon S3 servers for storage. It supports caching, segment level de duplication and snapshots </li>
	</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="project">
	<h2>General Systems Programming</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><h3>Memory Allocator (C) </h3> - Designed a general purpose dynamic memory allocator for C programs. Optimized its performance by implementing a segregated list with immediate coalescing, four byte pointers, footer elimination and combination of best and first fit placement policy</li>
		<li><h3>Cache Simulator</h3> - Coded a cache simulator that models hit/miss behavior of cache memory and outputs total number of hits, misses and evictions
		<li><h3>Multi-threaded Proxy (C) </h3> - Designed an HTTP proxy server program that supports caching of web objects and concurrent requests. Implemented multi-threading with appropriate locking mechanisms for accessing cache lines</li>
		<li><h3>Linux Shell (C) </h3> - Designed an interactive command line interpreter in C supporting job control, signal handling and I/O redirection</li>
		<li><h3>Kernel Programming (C, ARM, QEMU) </h3> - Designed a single-task mini-kernel that supports read, write and exit system calls and runs user space applications</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="project">
	<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
	<ul>
	<li><h3>Image Classifier (MATLAB, Kaggle) </h3> - Worked on designing novel image classifiers to perform a ten-class classification task on small color images in CIFAR-10 data set. Configured a majority-voting algorithm (Accuracy 62%) that uses the results of best supervised classifiers to generate combined predictions 
	</li>

	<h2>Front End Developement (HTML, CSS) </h2>
	<ul>
	<li><h3>Website</h3> - This website is my first attempt at front end developement. I am a beginner currently, but with consistent practice and experience I aim to reach intermediate level in a couple of weeks
	</li>
	</ul>
